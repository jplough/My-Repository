      "This problem lends iself well to agent based modelling as it will be the individual decision of each resident/business/entity to reduce its water consumption. The uptake of water reduction actions (through technological uptake and/or usage reduction) is non-deterministic process and one in which the actions of agents will affect and interact with eachother. To model how usage reduction will spread geographically across cities with several million residents, an ABM will be able to capture all of these effects and demonstrate a range of possile outcomes that a mathematical, deterministic model would not be able to convey.

      "I will be using my model to simulate the circumstances of the two cities/policies and determine a confidence interval for water usage reduction, looking of course at the 20% reduction target. It will also allow me to look at the various effects of technologies, incentive structures, and responsibility in composite as they sum to total reduction. I will essentially have the same model with tweaks that correspond to demographic and policy differences between the two cities. Santa Monica will have lower incentives and a usage penalty. Within each model, I will scale down the population to a reasonable number of agents (households) that can still be representative of the broader population, and will initialize them with some water usage rate based upon a stochastic household size variable and a normal distribution of per capita usage with current city average as the mean. They will also be imbued with a certain \"water usage strategy\" that refers to a vector of usage sources and mitigation actions that each agent may or may not be currently using, and some propensity to conserve based upon cost aversion (income), and some willingness/susceptability to change. I will initiate a grid to represent the spatial distribution of each city and will place each agent semi-randomly accross it, with hopefully some clustering vis-a-vis city demographics#. \n",
      "\n",
      "The time steps will be months, as this is how water bills are released and a reasonable point at which an agent will change their behavior. Each time step will be climate/weather dependent based on a stochastic, month weighted, precipitation function#, and agents will adjust their spending based upon income restrictions/cost aversion. These changes will be somewhat in flux or less permanant compared to uptake of water reduction technologies, which will move in a one month lag in response to T-1 time step#. This uptake will correspond to cost savings/private discount rates and also some random propensity to change. Finally, this stochastic propensity to change \"spontaneously\" given some level of social responsability and will also be influenced by grid neighbors' changes. Agents will move along from 0-100% reduction, where 100% is representative of some lower bound of per capita consumption across a household.  After two years and twenty four time steps, this 0-100% reduction will be compared to total usage per household agent, and a sum tabulation total household usage reduction will be tabulated, with shares from each reduction strategy represented as well. Comparing Santa Monica's penalty program to Los Angeles' incentivization strategy, the question of motivational strategy will also be answered via the differences between outcomes that can be attributed.\n",

Furthermore, in comparison between the two cities, the \"carrot versus stick\" argument of penalties versus incentives will be examined and the differences in agent behavior surrounding these different strategies will be illuminated. \n",

      "so a this point, i have most of my methods done and it makes basic sense, I think I have the bones and a good amount of the flesh, but I still need to figure out some tricky things. I need to figure out how to initialize with no penalty, and then stick it in after 1 period, and I also need to rethink the lower bound of reduction and also the interactional effects of the various methods of reduction. also the t/f 1/0 issue is something I'm thinking about. The main complications are in the hh class and initial model class code and not so much in the step phase, which kinda relates to theoretical as opposed to mechanistic difficulties. I am also trying to think about how to work a little more econ into the model (the elasticity parameter is my first attempt), and I want to really capture how decision making works under uncertainty, I am kind of assuming a total discount factor of future savings so I will probably figure out a way to incorporate future cost savings into the lawn change and low flow change pieces. I also may or may not add more technologies depending on if they seem just additive or are actually contributing new information, and I may examine a more complicated penalty structure. \n",

      "For now, I have a good shell of my model (one that I acknowledge is not ready to run at all), but I will be able to demonstrate how households influence eachother, how social responsability varies, how hh budget constraints factor in, how gov decisions (setting of penalties/subsidies) factor in and how likeley target reductions are to be met in the sphere of water policy in socal. I think these findings will be generalizable to other arid southwest cities facing similar issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hypothesize that the penalty system will result in higher reductions, and that subsidies and social responsibility would have to be rather large to offset this difference. I also think that this target is ambitious and unlikely, and I want to examine the assumptions (behavioral and parameter wise) that have gone into the policy making decision at this point. Another key assumption that I don't think I will test is full information, something I will probably comment on if not investigate in the final version.  "
